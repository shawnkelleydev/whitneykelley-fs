        My flute studio is based in the Denver Metro area, and I offer weekly
        private lessons to students from the age of 4 through adult seniors. I
        teach using the Suzuki Method, an approach that has been validated by
        many research studies as a very effective way to learn music (as well as
        other life-skills). The Suzuki Method is unique because it approaches
        music learning with the same principles as language acquisition.
        Specifically, it utilizes listening/imitation, repetition, delayed
        reading, creating a nurturing and supportive learning environment,
        building new skills with music already learned, and active parent
        involvement. Just as children learn language from a very young age, they
        can also begin to learn music when they are young. In fact, the early
        years are developmentally a crucial time for developing mental processes
        and muscle coordination, and music lessons are an effective way to
        maximize the childâ€™s potential during this time of their life. The
        principles of the Suzuki Method not only provide a framework for
        learning new skills in young and beginner students, but they are also
        very effective for advanced players as they learn to perfect advanced
        skills and, nurture their own creativity and musical voice, and perform
        at a professional level.

        Although learning music is a primary goal of my studio, I also strive to
        teach students how to use music as a tool of expression, communication,
        and connection. Students will be challenged to build problem-solving
        skills, cultivate attention to detail, navigate complex mental and
        physical tasks, and develop resilience, perseverance, confidence, and
        self-efficacy. Even after students graduate or move on from my studio,
        they have a deep sense of pride and joy in music that sticks with them
        for a lifetime.
