      "Emotional readiness is crucial. Is your child eager to learn new tasks? Do they get frustrated and give up easily, or do they show commitment to learning? Are they able to focus for 30 minutes at a time? Do they want to play the flute?",
      "Do you and your child have the time? Learning music takes a real time commitment in daily practicing, attending lessons, and involvement in special events throughout the year. Because parental involvement is such a crucial part of the Suzuki philosophy, this would require you to not only be present for each of these areas, but also to be actively involved.",
      "Are you willing to make a long-term commitment? Learning music is rewarding, but it is also a process that takes time. In the beginning, establishing fundamentals can sometimes seem to take forever, but the work pays off down the road. Are you willing to stick through the frustrating periods as well as the exciting ones?",
      "Do lessons fit your budget? In addition to the studio tuition rate, families must be prepared to buy or rent an instrument, purchase Suzuki music/CDs and other materials, and be prepared to invest in opportunities outside the studio.",
      "Come observe a lesson! I highly encourage prospective students to observe one of my current students in their lesson so that you can get a feel for my teaching style and the child can be sure that learning the flute is something that they really want to pursue.",

      "My flute studio is based in the Denver Metro area, and I offer weekly private lessons to students from the age of 4 through adult seniors. I teach using the Suzuki Method, an approach that has been validated by many research studies as a very effective way to learn music (as well as other life-skills). The Suzuki Method is unique because it approaches music learning with the same principles as language acquisition. Specifically, it utilizes listening/imitation, repetition, delayed reading, creating a nurturing and supportive learning environment, building new skills with music already learned, and active parent involvement. Just as children learn language from a very young age, they can also begin to learn music when they are young. In fact, the early years are developmentally a crucial time for developing mental processes and muscle coordination, and music lessons are an effective way to maximize the childâ€™s potential during this time of their life. The principles of the Suzuki Method not only provide a framework for learning new skills in young and beginner students, but they are also very effective for advanced players as they learn to perfect advanced skills and, nurture their own creativity and musical voice, and perform at a professional level.",
      "Although learning music is a primary goal of my studio, I also strive to teach students how to use music as a tool of expression, communication, and connection. Students will be challenged to build problem-solving skills, cultivate attention to detail, navigate complex mental and physical tasks, and develop resilience, perseverance, confidence, and self-efficacy. Even after students graduate or move on from my studio, they have a deep sense of pride and joy in music that sticks with them for a lifetime.",
